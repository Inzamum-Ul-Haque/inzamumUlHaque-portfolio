            I am Inzamum-Ul-Haque, a passionate software engineer with lots of
            hope and inspiration to do something interesting in life. I
            specialize in web development and love coding and building
            interactive full-stack websites. I find myself enthusiastic,
            proactive, and a self-driven learner who wants to learn new things
            and technologies to keep pace with the IT industry. <br />
            <br /> ðŸŽ¯ Currently, I am developing myself to be a full-stack
            junior developer and shaping up my skills in different stacks. I
            love taking inspiration from people who motivate others. I enjoy
            working in teams and try to learn the best that I can from others.
